# Overview
---

**This readme is currently a WIP!**

This demo shows how Full Stack and feature management could be applied to an Amazon Alexa skill.

This demo can be easily reused and modified for any purpose using the basic frame work and interaction model laid out in this repo.

### Interaction Model

1. Kick off skill + initiate Amazon "intent"
2. Alexa responds with a yes/no question (specific response string generated by Optimizely)
3. User then responds with affirmative or negative intent to the inital response
4. Affirmative or negaitve responses tracked in Optimizely

### Technologies Used

- AWS Lambda (for running the Alexa Skill code + Full Stack)
- Optimizely Node Full stack SDK
- Node ASK (Alex Skill Kit library)
- Amazon Developers - Alexa Skill
- Gulp to bundle zip file for Lambda

# Initial Setup
---

The most time consuming part of this demo is the inital setup to make sure your Amazon Developers + AWS accounts are properly linked.
## 1. Optimizely

Note: you can choose whether to create a new project per demo, or reuse an existing project

- Create an Optimizely Full Stack Project
- Create a feature flag called "AlexaDemo", or otherwise (you will need to implment this in the code in step 2)
- Create a variable in the code for "response" [string]. Note: this will be the string that the Alexa skill responds with
- Create an experiment using your Optimizely feature, and create one variation for each response that you want to demo (*NOTE* each response should end in a yes/no question)

## 2. Amazon Setup

- 

### 1. Amazon Developers - Alexa

- Create a new alexa skill on your developer account
- Add an invocation name 
- Create an intent called "OptimizelyDemo"
- Add an few phrases you want Amazon to interpret for your demo Skill
- Click "Save" and "Build Model"

### 2. AWS Lambda config
- connect lambda to your alexa skill
- upload zip file of skill code
- click "Save"

##3. Testing your Skill
